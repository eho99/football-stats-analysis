# football-stats-analysis
This repository contains the code to my Fantasy Football data analysis project. So far, I have programmed an RShiny app which displays football data from the past couple of seasons.  Data was scraped using the [nflfastR](https://www.nflfastr.com/) package.

Future additions include neural networks to predict season by season data. From prior research, it seems LSTM networks work well.
